Q2.
(i)
Semantics would describes the interaction between the
client and the server:
	– Essentially this relates to the sequence of request/response messages,
	– More usefully this can be described as “who talks first” i.e. which side issues the first message.
(ii)
Syntax describes the structure of the requestresponse messages. also describe it

(iii)

GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: www.dit.ie\r\n\r\n

if was successfull the respornse would be like:

HTTP/1.1 200 file found\r\n
Content-length:2340\r\n\r\n

Q3

(i)

X:       MAC:Src/Dst IP Address:Src/Dst Port:Src/DST DATA

(iii) 
A:{200.100.0.55:1234, 147.252.10.30:80}

Q5
(b)
server 1,2 
client 3

Q6
Ack:A would contain 701
Ack:B would contain 701 cuz 701-800 is lost
D is again 701-800
Ack:C would contain 901
E would represent 801-900 in buffer
F would represent 701-800 in buffer

For the server: the server has 2 different types of socket, a listening socket, and a connected socket
Explain each
Listening socket: when does it get created? It gets created when the application boots up/
launches the first one called is the socket primitive which is then transformed to a listening socket using the primitive listen. Listen is never closed.

Connected socket(in regards to server): a connected socket is created by the call to accept, when accept is called it only returns when a connection is established, 
the tcp entity will grab the next connection that’s in the connection queue and pass it to the application layer, 
which calls the accept. The connection sockets lifecycle: it terminates as soon as the interaction is complete, but once its finished it will use the close() primitive to close the connection.

a sockets purpose is to connect application layer to transport layer, to provide connectivity from application into the transport layer
(first protocol layer). A socket is in effect a connection between the application layer and transport layer used for moving data across a network.




not necesserally from apps perspective
